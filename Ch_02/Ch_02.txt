1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?

  ->  True and False

2. What are the three Boolean operators?

  -> and, or and not.

3. Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator (that is, every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what they evaluate to).

  -> and

    True and True   -> True
    True and False  -> False
    False and True  -> False
    False and False -> False

   -> or

    True and True   -> True
    True and False  -> True
    False and True  -> True
    False and False -> False

   -> not

    not True  -> False
    not False -> True

4. What do the following expressions evaluate to?

(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)                   -> False
not (5 > 4)                            -> False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)                    -> True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))              -> False
(True and True) and (True == False)    -> False
(not False) or (not True)              -> True

5. What are the six comparison operators?

   -> ==, !=, <, <=, >, >=

6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?

   The equal to operator(==) is a relational or comparison operator which checks whether its right hand side is equal to its left hand side and returns a boolean value(True or False). 
   The assignment operator(=) assign the value given on its right hand side to the variable given in its left hand side.

7. Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.

   A condition is a statement which is either true or false. We use conditions when we want to execute particular statements if the condition is either true or false.

8. Identify the three blocks in this code:

spam = 0
if spam == 10:
    print('eggs')                start of 1st block
    if spam > 5:
        print('bacon')           2nd block
    else:
        print('ham')             3rd block
    print('spam')                end of 1st block
print('spam')

9. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

	spam = int(input())
	if(spam == 1):
		print("Hello")
	elif(spamm == 2):
		print("Howdy")
	else:
		print("Greetings!")

10. What keys can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?

	CTRL+C or you can click the X button to close the shell.

11. What is the difference between break and continue?

	Brake, when executed, exits out of the loop, whereas ,continue, when executed, skips the rest of the statements in the loop during that iteration and continues with the next iteration.

12. What is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1) in a for loop?

	range(10) -> The value of the loop variable will change from 0 to 9 and the loop will execute 10 times.
	range(0, 10) -> The value of the loop variable will change from 0 to 9 and the loop will execute 10 times.
	range(0, 10, 1) -> The value of the loop variable will change from 0 to 9 and the loop will execute 10 times.

	Therefore all the three statements are the same.

13. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

	for i in range(1, 11):
		print(i)

	i = 1
	while(i < 11)
		print(i)
		i += 1

14. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?

	import spam
	spam.bacon()
